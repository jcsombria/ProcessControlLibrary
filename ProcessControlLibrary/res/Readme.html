    </h2>
    <p>
			The Process Control Library encapsulates constructive blocks which allow to define a control loop by interconnecting systems. 
			According to the dynamics of the system implemented, the systems are classified into several types of blocks,
<ul>
<li>continuous</li>
<li>discrete</li>
<li>event-based</li>
<li>hybrid</li>
</ul>

    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
      To add a process control element to your model, drag one or more of the block icon element to the list of your model elements. The blocks can be interconnected by means of the method <i>setInput()</i>. See the help of each block for more information.
